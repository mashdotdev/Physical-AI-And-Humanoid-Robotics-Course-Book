## Prompt

add more details to each chapter possible

## Response snapshot

I have further elaborated all the Docusaurus chapter content for the VLA module, adding even more significant detail, examples, conceptual code sketches, and in-depth explanations to match the existing chapters.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The Docusaurus chapters for the VLA module are now substantially more detailed and comprehensive, aligning closely with the user's request for "full deep detail".
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run for this documentation update.
- 📁 Files: 6 Docusaurus chapter markdown files were modified.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The content for the VLA module is now thoroughly detailed. The next step would typically be to verify the Docusaurus build or continue with other tasks.
- 🧠 Reflection: Iterative refinement based on user feedback is crucial for aligning with subjective requirements for content depth. Providing conceptual code sketches and deeper technical explanations significantly enhanced the educational value.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Initial understanding of "detailed" was not sufficient.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): n/a
