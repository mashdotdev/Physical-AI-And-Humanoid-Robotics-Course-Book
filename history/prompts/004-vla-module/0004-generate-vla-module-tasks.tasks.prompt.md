## Prompt

/sp.tasks

## Response snapshot

I have generated the `tasks.md` file for the VLA module, which breaks down the implementation into actionable tasks organized by user story.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully created the `tasks.md` file.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: 1 file was created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement
- 🧠 Reflection: The manual process for generating the tasks was straightforward, as all the required information was available in the design artifacts.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): n/a
