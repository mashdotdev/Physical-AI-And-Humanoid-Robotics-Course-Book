## Prompt

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response snapshot

Completed task generation for Chapter 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2). The detailed task list is available at `A:/Desktop/hackathon-book/specs/001-ros2-nervous-system/tasks.md`.
Total tasks: 20. Parallel opportunities identified in User Story 2. Suggested MVP: User Story 1 and 2.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Generated a detailed, executable task list for Chapter 1, following SDD principles.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: `tasks.md` created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to begin implementation based on the generated tasks.
- 🧠 Reflection: Task generation went smoothly. The structured approach in the prompt was effective.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
